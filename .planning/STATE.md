## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phone Auth (OTP) deferred to v2 — web reCAPTCHA complexity; v1 uses Google + email/password only
- [Roadmap]: Firestore security rules started in Phase 1 (not deferred) — open rules before real user data is project-ending risk
- [Roadmap]: PWA manifest and firebase.json set up in Phase 1 — cheap now, expensive to retrofit, requires deployed URL to validate
- [Roadmap]: Double-booking prevention via Firestore transaction with `slotId_dateString` doc ID — required in Phase 4, not optional
- [01-01]: flutter_bloc chosen for state management (flutter_bloc ^9.1.1, go_router ^17.1.0, equatable ^2.0.8 installed)
- [01-01]: BookingModel.generateId() enforces {slotId}_{date} pattern — always use this, never Firestore .add()
- [01-01]: price cast uses (data['price'] as num).toDouble() — Firestore may return int or double
- [01-01]: Firestore rules Phase 1 bootstrap — authentication-only guards, Phase 6 adds isAdmin() role checks
- [Phase 01-foundation]: flutter_bloc chosen for state management (flutter_bloc ^9.1.1, go_router ^17.1.0, equatable ^2.0.8 installed)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: BookingModel.generateId() enforces {slotId}_{date} pattern — always use .doc(id).set() inside Transaction, never .add()

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Flutter Web HTML vs. CanvasKit renderer choice affects auth form autofill — must be tested on deployed URL, not localhost
- [Phase 4]: Firestore offline persistence on Flutter Web interacts with booking transactions — must be tested in real browser early; disable web persistence for booking writes
